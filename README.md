# find equations
**Usefull for science and engineering students who need to memorize many different equations**
Find the right equation for given known variables you have and the ones you are trying to calculate. Think of it as Ctrl-F for equations.
## First setup
1. download the python script
2. create an empty *equations.csv* file
3. create an empty *variables.csv* file
4. run *python3 find_equations.py*

## How to use the script
- Write known variables and their description
- Write known equations this can only be done if all the variables used are already in the system.
- Enter the variables you have and the variable you are trying to calculate and the script will return all the possible equations you might want to use in order to calculate it. the equations are listed in the order of most usefull to least defined by number of matches.
